* *(List all necessary drivers and their versions)*

### Other Libraries/VIs

List any third-party libraries, custom VIs (not part of this project but are dependencies), or VI Packages (from VIPM) required:

* [e.g., OpenG Application Control Toolkit]
* [e.g., MyCustomLibrary.lvlib - specify source or include if not in repo]
* [e.g., Package Name from VIPM vX.X.X]

## Hardware Requirements (if applicable)

This project is designed to work with the following hardware:

* [e.g., NI cDAQ-9178 chassis]
* [e.g., NI 9215 C Series Module]
* [e.g., Specific model of a power supply, camera, sensor, etc.]
* *(Be as specific as possible)*

## Software Requirements (beyond LabVIEW)

Any other software needed to run or interact with this project:

* [e.g., Specific database software and version]
* [e.g., Python 3.x (if using Python nodes)]
* [e.g., .NET Framework version X.X]

## Project Structure & Key VIs

A brief overview of the project's organization:

* **`Main.vi` (or your primary VI):** [Brief description of what this main VI does and how to launch it.]
* **Project Explorer File:** `[YourProjectName].lvproj` - This is the main file to open the project and manage its contents.
* **Libraries (`.lvlib`):**
	* `[LibraryName1.lvlib]`: [Purpose of this library]
	* `[LibraryName2.lvlib]`: [Purpose of this library]
* **Classes (`.lvclass`):**
	* `[ClassName1.lvclass]`: [Purpose of this class]
* **SubVIs Folder:** `SubVIs/` [Description of common utilities or functional blocks]
* **Data Folder:** `Data/` [Description of any data files, configurations, etc.]
* *(Adjust this section to reflect your project's actual structure. Highlighting the entry point VI is crucial.)*

## How to Run / Use This Project

1.  **Clone the repository:**
	```bash
	git clone [URL_to_your_GitHub_repository]
	```
2.  **Ensure all [Dependencies](#dependencies) and [Hardware Requirements](#hardware-requirements-if-applicable) are met.**
3.  **Open the LabVIEW Project:** Navigate to the cloned directory and open `[YourProjectName].lvproj`.
4.  **Open the Main VI:** From the Project Explorer, open `[MainVI_Name.vi]` (e.g., `Main.vi`).
5.  **Run the VI:** Click the Run arrow on the Front Panel or Block Diagram of `[MainVI_Name.vi]`.
6.  **Instructions for use:**
	* [Step 1: e.g., Enter configuration parameters in the "Settings" tab.]
	* [Step 2: e.g., Press the "Start Acquisition" button.]
	* [Step 3: e.g., Observe the data on the "Results Graph".]
	* *(Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to operate your VI from the Front Panel.)*

## Screenshots (Optional)

*(It's highly recommended to add screenshots of your Front Panel(s) or key Block Diagram sections to give users a visual understanding of the project.)*

**Example Front Panel:**
**Example Block Diagram Snippet:**
## Building an Executable (if applicable)

If your project includes a Build Specification for creating an executable:

1.  Open `[YourProjectName].lvproj`.
2.  In the Project Explorer, find "Build Specifications".
3.  Expand it and right-click on `[Your_Build_Specification_Name]`.
4.  Select "Build".
5.  The executable will be located in `[Output_Directory_Specified_In_Build_Spec]`.
6.  *(Add any notes about installers or runtime engine requirements for the executable.)*

## Known Issues / Limitations

* [e.g., The current version does not support input voltages above X V.]
* [e.g., Performance degradation observed when logging more than Y channels simultaneously.]
* [e.g., UI may flicker if the window is resized rapidly.]

## Git & LabVIEW Notes

Working with LabVIEW files in Git requires some special considerations:

* **`.gitignore`:** A good `.gitignore` file is crucial for LabVIEW projects to exclude auto-generated files, backup files, and build artifacts. Ensure your repository has a comprehensive `.gitignore` for LabVIEW. (You can find templates online, e.g., searching for "LabVIEW gitignore").
* **VI Diff/Merge:** Natively, Git does not handle VI diffs and merges well due to the binary nature of VI files (though they are XML-based under the hood if uncompressed).
	* Consider using NI's built-in tools or third-party tools (like LVCompare for diffing) if you need to compare VI versions.
	* For merging, textual merge tools are generally not effective for VI block diagrams. Coordinate with your team to avoid concurrent modifications to the same VI. Use VI locking in the project if working in a team.
* **Saving VIs:** Always save VIs in the LabVIEW version specified or a newer one. Avoid down-saving unless absolutely necessary and tested.
* **Separation of Compiled Code:** In LabVIEW project settings (`File > Project Properties > Project`), ensure "Separate compiled code from source file" is **unchecked** for easier Git management if you are not using a specific workflow that requires it. If it's checked, Git might not track changes to the diagram if only compiled code changed. Most modern advice leans towards keeping it separate for cleaner diffs, so choose what works for your team and be consistent. *Edit: Modern best practice is often to **check** this (separate compiled code) to reduce binary changes when only data or settings change. Clarify your team's preference.*
